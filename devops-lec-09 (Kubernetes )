Kubernetes is used to manage container and deploy services.

kubectl --> kubernetes control , starting of every command
  
kubernetes also manages pod .

if container gets crashed pod is deployed.

Architecture (k8s architecture)(https://medium.com/@himanshusangshetty/kubernetes-architecture-and-components-explained-e489e98db15d)
Kubernetes works in cluster format.

Kubernetes master.
we have to set kubernetes master plane only once on premise .
API server performs communication between master and worker node.
SCheduler schedule pods in worker nods.If pod gets crash it makes it again.
Contoller- manager manages the work of maintaining of worker node.For example assinging pod according to requirement.
etcd is database of kubernetes which holds data of worker node.holds information about pods, services and much more.


Worker Node.
work done by us is worker node.
pod, kubelet,kube-proxy,docker(container runtime)
Pod manages container. In best practise one pod holds one container.Node may carry multiple pods.
Services in container is workload.
Kubelet is
kube proxy provides ip.
csi provides different types of storage to pods.

Pods are the most secured environment to run container.

FLOW of architecture.
what id pod get crashed?
first it will go to api server from kubelet then to conntroller and manager to chechk desired state. Then towards scheduler and then towards kubelets.Then kube proxy
will send traffic towards pod. 

killer koda for kubernetes 
kucectl --> command line tool to create resources in kuberneetes cluster.
