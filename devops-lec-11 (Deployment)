rollup--> going towards new update version


  vim deployment.yml 
  kubectl create -f deployment.yml --> 
  kubectl get deployments.apps
  kubectl describe deployments.apps
  kubectl get replicasets.apps
  kubectl get pod
  kubectl delete pod podname --> net pod get assiigned as it was to maintain the desired state 

  watch -n 2 kubectl get pod

  Replica set 

  deployment > replica set > pod > container   this is the flow of kubernetes

  kubectl get rs -->
  kubectl get nodes -->
  
Types of application 
1. statefull --> if an application is storing data continuosly 
2. stateless --> if an application doesn't stores data 

to manage data stored in statefull state 

elastic search consist of EFK
E --> elastic search stores data (statefull set)
F --> fluentd brings data (daemon state)
K --> kibana is the dashboard where data is shown (deployment)

daemon set --> pod gets created sutomatically in each services in daemon state.and that fetch data .
